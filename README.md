## Interactive App for Teaching Infants

Kids tend to get bored of toys very soon. They interact with them in every possible way and then they are done with it. I could buy ABC blocks easily from the market, but it just adds more to the landfill. 

So instead, I made this A-Z and 1-10 blocks for my 1.5 year old to interact with.

The application is live at

If you feel you can add onto the project, let's build it.
